# Introduction

InteractWith API is organized around GraphQL. Our API has predictable resource-oriented namings.

To make requests to the API, you need to use an API key. You can find your API key in the InteractWith dashboard.

InteractWith API are by default cross-chain. You can check the list of supported chains in the [InteractWith API Reference](https://docs.interactwith.io/api-reference/overview).

You can use InteractWith API through InteractWith SDK for the languages we support. If the language you are using is not supported, you can use the InteractWith API directly through GraphQL.
