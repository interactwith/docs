# GraphQL Playground

To help developers easily interact with the InteractWith API and test out queries, we provide a GraphQL Playground. The GraphQL Playground is a web-based GraphQL Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that makes it easy to write, execute, and debug GraphQL queries. It is accessible at the following URL: [https://api.interactwith.com/graphql](https://api.interactwith.com/graphql).

The GraphQL Playground offers a number of useful features that can help you get the most out of the InteractWith API. Some of these features include syntax highlighting, real-time error highlighting, and a query history that allows you to easily revisit and re-execute previous queries. These features can save you time and effort as you develop and test your application, and can make it easier to work with the API.

## How to use the GraphQL Playground

To use the GraphQL Playground, you will first need to add your API key to the HTTP header of your request. The header is the part of the request that contains additional information about the request, such as the type of content being sent, the intended recipient, and so on. To include the API key in the header, you need to add a special header called `X-API-KEY` with a value of your API key.

Once you have added your API key to the header, you can start writing your GraphQL queries in the left panel of the GraphQL Playground. You can use the autocomplete feature to help you write your queries, and you can also use the documentation explorer to learn more about the API and see examples of how to use it.

When you are ready to execute your query, simply click the `Play` button. This will send your query to the InteractWith API, and the result will be displayed in the right panel of the GraphQL Playground. You can use the result panel to see the data that is returned by your query and to debug any issues that may arise.

Overall, the GraphQL Playground is a powerful and convenient tool that can help you get the most out of the InteractWith API and build powerful decentralized applications.
