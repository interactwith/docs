# Supported Chains

The InteractWith API supports a wide range of different blockchain networks, which allows developers to build decentralized applications that can interact with multiple chains or take advantage of the unique features of specific chains. Currently, the InteractWith API supports the following chains:

| Chain | Key | Type
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ethereum | eth | mainnet |
| Goerli | goerli | testnet |
| BNB Smart Chain | bnb | mainnet |
| BNB Smart Chain Testnet | bnb-testnet | testnet |

These chains are the ones that are currently fully supported and can be used with the InteractWith API.

In addition to these fully supported chains, the InteractWith API is also planning to support a number of additional chains in the near future. These chains are not yet fully supported, but they are being actively worked on and will be available for use with the API as soon as they are ready. The list of chains that will be supported soon is as follows:

| Chain | Key | Type
| --- | --- | --- |
| Polygon | polygon | mainnet |
| Mumbai Testnet | mumbai | testnet |
| Avalanche | avalanche | mainnet |
| Solana Devnet | solana-devnet | testnet |
| Solana | solana | mainnet |

We are excited to be adding these new chains to the InteractWith API and are working hard to make them available as soon as possible. Stay tuned for updates on the availability of these chains, and check the InteractWith API Reference for the latest information on supported chains.
