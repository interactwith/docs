# About Event Emitters

Event Emitters are a type of instance that is used to maintain consistency between InteractWith and your backend. They are responsible for notifying your backend about certain events that occur on InteractWith. For example, when an NFT is transferred to another wallet, the Event Emitter will notify your backend about this event and wait for your backend to confirm that the event has been processed. If your backend confirms that the event has been processed, the Event Emitter will mark the event as processed and will not notify your backend about it again. If your backend does not confirm that the event has been processed, the Event Emitter will notify your backend about the event again after a certain amount of time has passed.

## Event Emitter Types

There are two types of Event Emitters that you can use with the InteractWith API:

### Webhook Event Emitter

Webhook Event Emitters are Event Emitters that notify your backend about events by sending HTTP requests to your backend. You can use Webhook Event Emitters to notify your backend about events that occur on InteractWith.

### Websocket Event Emitter

Websocket Event Emitters are Event Emitters that notify your backend about events by sending messages to your backend over a WebSocket connection. You can use Websocket Event Emitters to notify your backend about events that occur on InteractWith. This type of Event Emitter is useful for private networks, local development, and other situations where you cannot expose your backend to the Internet.

Here is an example of how you might use an Event Emitter in your code:

**Example:**

<CodeBlock language="js">
{[
  'const event_emitter = new interactwith.EventEmitter({',
  '  event_emitter_id: "EVENT_EMITTER_ID",',
  '});',
  '',
  'event_emitter.on("Minter.NftTransferred", (event) => {',
  '  console.log(event);',
  '});',
].join('\n')}
</CodeBlock>

:::tip

It is important to make sure that your event handlers are idempotent, which means that they should not process the same event multiple times. You can use the event.id field to identify the event and ensure that it is not processed more than once. The same applies to Webhook Event Emitters.

Here is an example of the response that you might receive when an Event Emitter sends an event to your backend:

**Response:**

```js
{
  id: 'EVENT_ID',
  event_emitter_id: 'EVENT_EMITTER_ID',
  event_type: 'Minter.NftTransferred',
  event_data: {
    nft_id: 'NFT_ID',
    from: 'FROM_WALLET_ID',
    to: 'TO_WALLET_ID',
  },
  processed: false,
  created_at: '2021-07-01T12:00:00.000Z',
  updated_at: '2021-07-01T12:00:00.000Z',
}
```
