# GraphQL Playground

For better developer experience, we provide a GraphQL Playground for you to interact with the API. You can find the GraphQL Playground at [https://api.interactwith.com/graphql](https://api.interactwith.com/graphql).

The GraphQL Playground is a web-based GraphQL IDE. It provides features such as syntax highlighting, real-time error highlighting, and query history.

## How to use the GraphQL Playground

First of all you need to add your API key to the HTTP header of your request. The header name is `X-API-KEY`. The value of the header is your API key.

Then you can start writing your GraphQL queries in the left panel. You can use the autocomplete feature to help you write your queries. You can also use the documentation explorer to learn more about the API.

When you are ready, you can click the `Play` button to execute your query. The result will be displayed in the right panel.
