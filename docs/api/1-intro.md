# Introduction

The InteractWith API is a powerful tool that allows developers to easily interact with various blockchain networks. The API is built around GraphQL, which is a flexible and efficient query language for your API. This means that you can make requests to the API in a predictable and resource-oriented manner.

To access the InteractWith API, you will need to use an API key, which can be found in the InteractWith dashboard. This key is necessary to authenticate your requests and ensure that only authorized users have access to the API.

One of the great features of the InteractWith API is that it is cross-chain by default, which means that it can be used to interact with a variety of different blockchain networks. You can view the list of supported chains in the InteractWith API Reference.

In addition to using the API directly through GraphQL, you can also utilize the InteractWith SDK for certain languages. This can make it even easier to integrate the API into your application and start interacting with blockchain networks.
