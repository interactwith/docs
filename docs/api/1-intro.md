# Introduction

The InteractWith API is a comprehensive tool that allows developers to easily build applications that interact with blockchain networks. It is built using GraphQL, which is a powerful and flexible query language that makes it easy to request the data you need in a predictable and resource-oriented way.

To use the InteractWith API, you will need to obtain an API key from the InteractWith dashboard. This key is necessary to authenticate your requests and ensure that only authorized users have access to the API.

One of the key benefits of the InteractWith API is that it is cross-chain by default, which means that it can be used to interact with a wide range of different blockchain networks. The API supports a variety of popular networks, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and more. You can view the full list of supported chains in the InteractWith API Reference.

In addition to using the API directly through GraphQL, you can also make use of the InteractWith SDK for various programming languages. The InteractWith SDK provides a simple and convenient way to integrate the API into your application, allowing you to easily interact with blockchain networks and perform various actions such as minting and transferring NFTs.

Overall, the InteractWith API is a valuable resource for developers looking to build applications that utilize the capabilities of blockchain networks. Whether you are working with Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or another popular network, the InteractWith API makes it easy to get started and start building with confidence.
