# Events List

The InteractWith API provides a range of events that you can listen for using event emitters. These events are triggered by specific actions or changes within the API, and can provide valuable information about the state of your NFTs and other data.

Using event emitters, you can set up listeners for specific events and receive notification whenever an event is triggered. Each event includes a payload object that provides detailed information about the NFT or other data that was affected by the event.

The events coming from Event Emitters includes payload as an object of an NFT that was affected.

:::tip

An `id` field is the unique identifier of the event, you can use it as an idempotency key to avoid double processing of the same event.
