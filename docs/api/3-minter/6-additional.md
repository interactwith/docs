## Contract addresses

This table contains the contract addresses for the contracts in the networks we support.

| Network | Contract Address | ABI |
| ------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Ethereum | 0x8a9c67fee641579deba04928c4bc45f66e26343a | [ABI](https://qwe.qwe) |
| Goerli | 0x8a9c67fee641579deba04928c4bc45f66e26343a | [ABI](https://qwe.qwe) |
| BNB Smart Chain | 0x8a9c67fee641579deba04928c4bc45f66e26343a | [ABI](https://qwe.qwe) |
| BNB Smart Chain Testnet | 0x8a9c67fee641579deba04928c4bc45f66e26343a | [ABI](https://qwe.qwe) |

This table provides information on the contract addresses, contract names, and ABIs for the contracts on different networks. These resources can be useful if you want to interact with the contracts directly using a tool like Remix or a custom application. You can use the contract addresses to access the contracts on the blockchain, and the ABIs to decode and encode data that is sent to and received from the contracts. You may also find the contract names useful for reference and organization purposes.
