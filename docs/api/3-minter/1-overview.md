# Minter Overview

The Minter API is a tool that allows you to mint digital assets on the blockchain for your players. This can be useful if you have a game and want to offer your players the ability to mint and own unique digital items. With just one request to the Minter API, you can mint your players' assets and connect them to the blockchain.

One of the key features of the Minter API is its ability to provide real-time information to app developers through Webhooks or Websockets. This ensures that your backend is always up-to-date with the blockchain, and allows you to track and monitor your players' assets in real-time. This can help create more engaging and immersive experiences for your players, and can provide valuable insights into how they use your game.

Minting assets with the Minter API is quick and easy, and does not require any knowledge of the fees mechanism in different blockchains. We take care of all gas fees for you, and will charge a fee in fiat periodically for this service. However, if your players prefer, they are also free to pay with crypto.

The Minter API consists of two main components:

- [Minter Checkouts](/) - This is a tool that allows users to mint assets in a special session with an interface and payment system. NFTs can only be created through a checkout.
- [NFTs](/) - An NFT is a unique digital asset that is created through a checkout.

Overall, the Minter API is a powerful and easy-to-use tool that can help you offer your players unique and valuable digital assets on the blockchain.
