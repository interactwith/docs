# Minter Checkouts

Minter Checkouts provide a simple and straightforward interface for creating NFTs, allowing users to specify details such as the name, symbol, and total supply of the NFT, as well as any additional metadata that they want to include. Once the NFT has been created, users can then mint new tokens and sell them on the market.

## Methods

### Creating a Checkout

To create a Minter Checkout, you can use the following code snippet:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
<JsExample resource="MinterCheckoutSession" method="create"/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="gql" label="GraphQL">
<GqlExample resource="MinterCheckoutSession" method="create"/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
