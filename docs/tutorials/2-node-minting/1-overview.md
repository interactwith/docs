# Before you start

Welcome to this tutorial on minting your first NFT using the Minter API! In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of minting an NFT on the Goerli network and then tracking its movement on the blockchain using the EventEmitter API.

Before we get started, it's important to have a basic understanding of what NFTs are and how they work. NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token, and it represents a unique digital asset that cannot be exchanged for other assets on a one-to-one basis. In other words, NFTs are unique and cannot be replaced by other assets.

Now, let's talk about the prerequisites for this tutorial. First, you will need an InteractWith account. If you don't already have one, you can easily create one by following the link provided in the tutorial. You will also need an API key, which can be obtained from your InteractWith account. In addition, you will need the Metamask browser extension (or any other wallet that supports the Ethereum network) and a coding IDE such as VS Code or Sublime Text. Finally, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

With all of these things in place, you are ready to begin minting your first NFT. Let's get started!
