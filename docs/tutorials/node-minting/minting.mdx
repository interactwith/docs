# Minting an NFT

In this tutorial, we will mint an NFT using the InteractWith API. We will use the `@interactwith/node` package to interact with the API.

## Create InteractWith client

To interact with the InteractWith API, you need to create an InteractWith client. You can create an InteractWith client using the `InteractWith` constructor from the `@interactwith/node` package.

```js
const { InteractWith } = require("@interactwith/node");

const interactWith = new InteractWith({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY"
});
```

## Creating a Minter Checkout

To mint an NFT, you need to create a Minter Checkout. You can create a Minter Checkout using the `minter_checkout.create()` method from the InteractWith client.

```js
const minterCheckout = await interactWith.minter_checkout.create({
  name: "My NFT",
  description: "My NFT description",
  image: "https://example.com/my-nft.png",
  external_url: "https://example.com/my-nft",
  attributes: [
    {
      trait_type: "Background",
      value: "Blue",
    },
  ],
});
```

:::tip

If you are using some of testnets (e.g. Goerli), the checkout will be fake (free).

## Going through the Minter Checkout flow

After creating a Minter Checkout, you can go through the Minter Checkout flow by redirecting the user to the `url` property of the Minter Checkout. Lets go through the flow instead of user. You will see something similar to this:

## Tracking when the NFT is minted

After the user has completed the Minter Checkout flow, you can track when the NFT is minted by using the [EventEmitter API](/docs/api/event-emitter). You can listen for the `nft_minted` event using the `on()` method from the InteractWith client.

```js
interactwith.on("nft_minted", (nft) => {
  console.log("NFT minted", nft);
});
```

But thats very basic tracking. See next page for more detailed tracking.
