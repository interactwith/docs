# Before start

In this tutorial, you will learn how to mint your first NFT using Minter API. You will mint an NFT on the Goerli network. After minting you will need to track the NFT movement on the blockchain using [EventEmitter API](/docs/api/getting-started/event-emitters).

## Legenda

We will imagine that we are creating some kind of a game. In this game, we have items that can be minted to an NFT.
