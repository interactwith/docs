# Minter Overview

If you have a game and you want to allow your players to mint their digital assets on the blockchain, you can use InteractWith's API to do this quickly and easily. With just one request to our API, you can mint your players' assets and connect them to the blockchain.

Additionally, our architecture is designed to provide advanced information to app developers through Webhooks or Websockets. This can include information about the movement of assets from one wallet to another, allowing you to track and monitor your players' assets in real-time. This can help you create more engaging and immersive experiences for your players, and can provide valuable insights into how they are using your game.

When minting assets using InteractWith's API, you do not need to worry about paying any crypto fees or understanding the fees mechanism in each blockchain. We take care of all gas fees for you, and will charge a fee in fiat periodically for this service. 

However, if the players prefer, they are also free to pay with crypto. Regardless of how they choose to pay, the minting process is quick and easy, and does not require any knowledge of the fees mechanism in different blockchains. We handle everything for you, so you can focus on creating exciting and engaging experiences for your users.
